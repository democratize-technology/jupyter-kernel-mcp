# Jupyter Kernel MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server that provides AI assistants with a stateful, persistent workspace through Jupyter kernels.

## What is this?

This MCP server enables AI assistants (like Claude) to execute code in persistent Jupyter kernel sessions. Unlike traditional code execution which starts fresh each time, this maintains state across conversations - variables, imported libraries, and running processes persist between messages.

### Key Features

- **Persistent State**: Variables and imports remain available across messages
- **Multi-language Support**: Python, R, Julia, Go, Rust, TypeScript, and more
- **Notebook Management**: Create, edit, and manage Jupyter notebooks
- **Real-time Execution**: Stream output as code runs
- **Search Capabilities**: Find code across all notebooks
- **Automatic Reconnection**: WebSocket connections retry with exponential backoff
- **AI-Friendly Discovery**: Context-aware suggestions for next steps

### Use Cases

- **Data Analysis**: Load large datasets once, analyze across multiple conversations
- **Development**: Build and test code incrementally with full state preservation
- **Education**: Step-by-step tutorials where each step builds on the last
- **Research**: Long-running experiments that span multiple sessions

## Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd jupyter-kernel-mcp
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

This project uses `uv` for dependency management. If you don't have `uv` installed:

```bash
# Install uv (if not already installed)
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
```

### 3. Configure Environment

The server requires configuration to connect to your Jupyter instance. Copy the example configuration file:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Then edit `.env` with your specific settings:

```bash
# For Jupyter server
JUPYTER_HOST=localhost
JUPYTER_PORT=8888
JUPYTER_TOKEN=your-jupyter-token-here
```

### 4. Finding Your Jupyter Token

If you're running Jupyter locally:

```bash
jupyter server list
```

This will show output like:
```
http://localhost:8888/?token=abc123... :: /path/to/notebooks
```

Copy the token value and add it to your `.env` file.

### Configuration Options

#### Jupyter Server Settings

- `JUPYTER_HOST` - The hostname or IP address of your Jupyter server (default: `localhost`)
- `JUPYTER_PORT` - The port your Jupyter server is listening on (default: `8888`)
- `JUPYTER_PROTOCOL` - Protocol for HTTP connections: `http` or `https` (default: `http`)
- `JUPYTER_WS_PROTOCOL` - Protocol for WebSocket connections: `ws` or `wss` (default: `ws`)
- `JUPYTER_TOKEN` - Authentication token for Jupyter (required)

### Example Configurations

#### Local Jupyter Server

```bash
JUPYTER_HOST=localhost
JUPYTER_PORT=8888
JUPYTER_PROTOCOL=http
JUPYTER_WS_PROTOCOL=ws
JUPYTER_TOKEN=your-token-here
```

#### Remote Jupyter Server with HTTPS

```bash
JUPYTER_HOST=jupyter.example.com
JUPYTER_PORT=443
JUPYTER_PROTOCOL=https
JUPYTER_WS_PROTOCOL=wss
JUPYTER_TOKEN=your-secure-token
```

## Running the Server

### Prerequisites

1. **Jupyter Server**: You need a running Jupyter server. If you don't have one:

   ```bash
   # Install Jupyter
   pip install jupyter
   
   # Start Jupyter (in a separate terminal)
   jupyter notebook --no-browser
   ```

2. **Environment Configuration**: Make sure you've created and configured your `.env` file (see Setup section above)

### Starting the MCP Server

Once Jupyter is running and configured:

```bash
./run_server.sh
```

Or directly with Python:

```bash
uv run python jupyter_kernel_mcp.py
```

The server will attempt to connect to your Jupyter instance using the configuration in your `.env` file.

## MCP Client Configuration

To use this server with an MCP client (like Claude Desktop), add this to your MCP settings:

```json
{
  "jupyter-kernel": {
    "command": "/path/to/jupyter-kernel-mcp/run_server.sh"
  }
}
```

Replace `/path/to/jupyter-kernel-mcp` with the actual path where you cloned this repository.

## Available Tools

The server provides several tools for AI assistants to use:

### Core Execution Tools

- **`compute()`** - Smart execution with auto-detection of streaming needs
- **`q()`** - Quick compute for simple calculations
- **`execute()`** - Full control execution with detailed results
- **`stream_execute()`** - Real-time streaming output with timestamps

### Discovery & State Management

- **`suggest_next()`** - Context-aware suggestions based on current kernel state
- **`vars()`** - Peek at variables in memory
- **`workspace()`** - Bird's eye view of all kernels and notebooks
- **`kernel_state()`** - Detailed state inspection with memory usage

### Notebook Operations

- **`notebook()`** - Natural language notebook operations (create, add, read, etc.)
- **`create_notebook()`** - Create new notebooks
- **`add_to_notebook()`** - Add code to existing notebooks
- **`search_notebooks()`** - Search across all notebooks

### System Management

- **`list_available_kernels()`** - See supported languages
- **`reset()`** - Clear kernel state (use sparingly!)

## New Features

### Automatic Reconnection

The server now includes automatic WebSocket reconnection with exponential backoff. If a connection fails, it will:

1. Retry with increasing delays (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, up to 30s)
2. Show encouraging messages during retries
3. Gracefully handle transient network issues

### Context-Aware Suggestions

The new `suggest_next()` tool provides intelligent suggestions based on your current state:

```python
# After loading a DataFrame
>>> suggest_next()
ðŸ”® Based on your current state:

ðŸ“Š You have a DataFrame 'df' loaded (1000Ã—5)
You might want to:
  â€¢ df.describe() - Get statistical summary
  â€¢ df.info() - Check data types and memory usage
  â€¢ df.head(10) - View first 10 rows
  â€¢ df.isnull().sum() - Check for missing values
```

## Troubleshooting

### Connection Refused

If you get connection errors:
- Verify Jupyter is running: `jupyter server list`
- Check your `JUPYTER_HOST` and `JUPYTER_PORT` settings
- Ensure your firewall allows connections to the Jupyter port

### Authentication Failed

If you get authentication errors:
- Verify your `JUPYTER_TOKEN` is correct
- Try regenerating the token by restarting Jupyter
- Check that the token matches exactly (no extra spaces)
